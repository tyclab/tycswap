// migrate_macos_keyring_to_security (spec 07§5.4): relocates any pre-existing
// macOS `keyring`-library backup-credential entries (legacy service
// "claude-code") to the security-CLI-backed "tycswap" Keychain service —
// a *different* service in the same Keychain, so source and destination
// coexist safely during write → verify → delete, identical in shape to the
// Windows migration.
//
// DESIGN Amendment A9 simplifies the Go port relative to Python here: Python
// prefers the third-party `keyring` library for legacy reads and only falls
// back to shelling out to `security` when `keyring` itself is unusable
// (NoKeyringError/InitError) — a distinction that exists because Python has
// two genuinely different backends. A from-scratch Go binary has only one:
// `internal/keychain`'s /usr/bin/security wrapper, used for *both* the legacy
// "claude-code" service and the new "tycswap" service (the legacy read
// simply targets the old service string). There is therefore no
// keyring-unavailable/security-fallback branch to reproduce — every Keychain
// failure here is uniformly a hard failure that retries next run, which is
// exactly Python's behavior for a locked/denied Keychain (the one case that
// was never eligible for its fallback in the first place).
