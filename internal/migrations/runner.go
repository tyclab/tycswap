// Run (spec 07§5.2, §5.5): the migration registry and its runner. Order
// matters only if migrations ever depend on each other — today they're
// platform-disjoint and independent, so registry order is arbitrary but fixed
// for determinism.
//
// Run never returns an error and never panics out to its caller: every
// migration's failure (a returned error, or — belt-and-suspenders beyond
// Python's blanket `except Exception` — a recovered panic) is logged via
// host.Logger() and left unmarked so the next launch retries it. A migration
// that reports "skip" (completed=false, err=nil) is recorded nowhere, silently,
// exactly like Python's runner: only a *completed* migration ever gets a
// .migrations.json entry.
//
// Construction-order note (spec 07§5.6/§9, DESIGN Appendix): store.New must
// call Run as its LAST construction step, after the credential-store
// abstraction is built (the macOS migration performs storage ops through it)
// and after every other fallible/non-fallible setup step — and Run itself
// must never be allowed to abort construction, unlike the legacy-backup-dir
// relocation (paths.MigrateLegacyBackupDir) that runs first and *can* raise.
// Swapping that ordering, or making Run fallible, would be an observable
// regression this package cannot itself guard against — it's store.New's
// responsibility to call Run in the right place.

// returns to its caller to print wherever it prints such things — this
// package never writes to stdout/stderr itself, keeping it free of any
// printer/cli dependency. err non-nil means "partially failed, retry next
// run" (Python's MigrationIncomplete, or any other exception).
