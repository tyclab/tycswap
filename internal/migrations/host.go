// Package migrations is claude-swap's one-time, self-guarded compatibility
// migration registry: relocating legacy per-account backup-credential storage
// (Windows Credential Manager → files, macOS third-party `keyring` library →
// the security-CLI-backed "tycswap" Keychain service) and tracking which
// migrations have already run in <backup_dir>/.migrations.json.
//
// Implements spec 07§5 (migrations.py) in full, plus 07§9's Go-port notes on
// what to keep: both registry migrations exist to rescue data from storage
// backends a from-scratch Go binary never wrote to itself, but that a user
// upgrading from an old Python claude-swap release may still be sitting on —
// so their read/relocate logic (and the .migrations.json state-tracking
// format) is preserved even though the Go binary never writes to those legacy
// backends.
//
// Host is declared here — not in internal/store — specifically to break the
// store→migrations→store construction cycle (DESIGN Amendment A3): store.New
// builds an adapter satisfying Host and calls Run(host) as construction step 7
// (spec 07§5.6/§9). migrations never imports store.

	// DeleteBackup sweep, which would also touch an unrelated .enc file). Off
