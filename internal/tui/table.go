// A row is either a WINDOW row (its own window cells, laid into the columns) or
// a SPAN row (one message that spans the window columns — the quarantined /
// sentinel / usage-unknown shapes). Columns are the union of the window labels
// the WINDOW rows report, ordered CANONICALLY — 5h, then 7d, then the scoped
// windows by name (tableColumns) — a TOTAL order, so the header is a function of
// the label multiset and never of the order the rows arrive in; a row missing a
// column renders an em dash in it. Two windows one row reports under the SAME
// label are two columns, not one: every reported figure keeps a cell of its own,
// and the pair is admitted or dropped together.
//
// Emphasis is per CELL (DESIGN A18), and color and weight say different
// things. A COUNTED window carries its own SEVERITY color, binding or not —
// severity is what the figure MEANS, and it means the same here as in the
// account card's bars, the mini account line and tycswap list. An EXHAUSTED
// window carries it too, counted or not. BOLD, alone, marks the row's BINDING
// window: the figure the ranking and the engine act on. Only an UNCOUNTED
// window still short of its limit drives nothing at all, and only that one is
// muted and dim. Binding is per ROW, not per column — two rows can bind on
// different columns —
// while counted-ness is a property of the column (the configured
// autoswitch.model axis), so a COLUMN HEADER is muted, and additionally dim
// when its column is uncounted: the header row and the panel's "counting …"
// note always agree.
//
// A column is sized from its DATA and never from its name: the sub-cell fits the
// percentages it carries, and the header is fitted over that. A name too wide
// for the room is ABBREVIATED, every column together and only ever to a level at
// which no two labels read alike (headerLadders) — an ambiguous header is terse,
// a colliding one is false. So the same three accounts cost the same whether
// their model is called "Fable" or "claude-opus-4-5-20251101".
//
// The table NEVER wraps. It sheds detail in a fixed order (renderWindowTable's
// ladder) in which every MEASUREMENT outranks NAMING and IDENTITY outranks
// naming too — the headers abbreviate first, then the countdowns go, then the
// label cell narrows to a bare ellipsis, before any figure leaves the row. What
// a window is called is the cheapest thing on the row: a header names a column
// the reader can also read off the figures beneath it, while a countdown states
// something no other cell does. Narrowing a terminal only ever takes detail
// away and widening one only ever gives it back.
//
// WHAT IT MAY NEVER SHED IS DECLARED, NOT GUARDED. pinTableColumns names the
// columns no width may drop — every counted one, the one carrying each row's
// own ranking figure, and, where the surface's per-row layout says so, every
// column an account has run out in — and minTableWidth is the closed-form width
// of the fully-shed table that keeps them. Below it no table EXISTS: the caller
// renders its own per-row layout for every row at once, never a table for some
// rows and per-row layout for others. That comparison reads no clock, so a reset
// coming due cannot take a table away, and it is monotone, so a terminal that
// grew never loses one.
//
// WHETHER A TABLE THAT EXISTS IS THE ONE TO DRAW IS PRICED, NOT ASSUMED
// (pickWindowTable). A union-column table is not universally better than a
// per-row layout: its columns are the union ACROSS rows, so every row pays the
// gutter and sub-cell of every other row's windows — the em dashes where it
// reports no such window included — while a per-row layout pays only for what
// its own row has. On a roster whose accounts report different scoped models the
// table therefore states the same figures in more columns and buys them by
// shedding the countdowns the per-row layout still affords. So both layouts are
// built at the width in hand and scored on what they DISPLAY — figures, reset
// countdowns, columns of a span row's reason — and the table is drawn only where
// it is no worse on every one of those axes (layoutScore). Identity is not among
// them: a shared grid buys its alignment out of the email, and the slot number
// names the account either way.
//
// The bar it must clear is FIXED rather than local, which is what keeps the
// choice monotone: it is the per-row layout priced at the width where the table
// itself stops shedding (fullWidth), so the widths the table is drawn at are
// upward closed and widening a terminal can never take a figure, a countdown or
// a reason back. See releaseBar for why the local form is not monotone, in
// measured columns. Nothing but the WINDOW rows' own desire is charged to that
// width: a reference that also reserved the widest span message let the LENGTH
// of one account's reason decide whether every other account got columns.
//
// AND THE PRICE READS NO CLOCK. A countdown's spelling narrows as it ticks, so a
// score taken from the text a layout would draw moves between frames, and a
// choice taken from such a score flips at a fixed terminal width with no resize.
// So the layout that is PRICED and the layout that is DRAWN are two readings of
// the same rows: pricing spells every countdown at the widest its grammar can
// produce (countdownWidest), which makes the choice a pure function of (rows,
// width, surface); drawing spells them live, so it sheds no more than the price
// assumed and the terminal receives at least what cleared the bar. The
// alternative — reserving the widest spelling in the drawn layout — buys the
// same stability with real columns on every frame.
//
// The label is the one cell EVERY row shares, so no single row may narrow it
// past what that row is guaranteed: every column a SPAN row's message takes
// there is a column taken from every other account's identity. A span message
// therefore narrows it only as far as its own FLOOR (spanFloor) demands. It is
// then DRAWN after that row's own label rather than after the shared column —
// the row lays no figure into any column, so it has nothing to align with, and
// charging it for a longer email two rows down would make it say less than the
// per-row layout it replaces.
//
// WHAT A SHARED GRID CANNOT DO, stated so a later reader does not go looking
// for it: a column is bought for every row or for none, so one account's window
// can still cost another account a figure. Which column goes is therefore the
// only fairness question a table can answer, and it is answered — the group the
// fewest accounts report goes first — but the TABLE is not, at every width, a
// superset of what a per-row layout would say about every account. On the
// monitor it is, because that surface's per-row layout states only pinned
// columns; on the panel it is not, and the widths where it is not are measured
// and pinned rather than argued about (DESIGN A18, I13). What IS true at every
// width is that the SURFACE says no less than its own per-row layout, because at
// those widths the surface draws the per-row layout instead.

// A union-column table is not universally better than a per-row layout, and the

// pays the gutter and the sub-cell of every OTHER row's windows — including the

// the width ladder's rungs fixes that; it is the price of alignment.
//
// So both surfaces build BOTH layouts at the width they were given, price each
// with this score, and draw the one that displays more (pickWindowTable, and
// releaseBar for the exact bar). The three DATA axes are the reader's three
// questions — how used is each window (figures), when does each free up
// (countdowns), and why can the engine not use this account (spanChars) — and
// identChars is deliberately not among them.

// spelling, so the bar reads no clock.
//
// WHY THE BAR IS NOT SIMPLY THE PER-ROW LAYOUT AT THIS WIDTH. Dominance measured
// at the render width alone is not monotone, and that is a measurement rather
// than a worry: the two layouts are INCOMPARABLE over a band of widths — the
// table states more figures, the per-row layout more countdowns — and a choice
// that flips inside such a band takes back on one axis what it gives on another.
// On this corpus the flip costs three of six figures on a panel one column WIDER
// (29 → 30), which is precisely the "widening a terminal only ever gives detail
// back" contract the whole ladder exists to keep.
//
// A CONSTANT reference removes it. Both layouts are individually monotone in the
// width, so a bar that does not move with the width makes the set of widths the
// table is drawn at UPWARD CLOSED, and an upward-closed choice between two
// monotone layouts is monotone on every axis:
//
//   - both widths draw the same layout — that layout is monotone;
//   - per-row below, table above: at the single boundary w₀ the table displays at
//     least the bar, and the bar is the per-row layout at fullWidth ≥ w₀, which is
//     at least what the per-row layout displayed at w₀−1;
//   - table below, per-row above CANNOT HAPPEN — that is what upward closure is.
//
// THE PROOF TURNS ON THE REFERENCE BEING CONSTANT, so what may enter it is
// exactly what does not move with the width or the clock: the window rows' full
// desire, measured on a fresh layout with every countdown at countdownWidest. A
// span row's message length is not among them — it moves nothing about the
// window rows and would price every account's bar off one account's sentence —
// and neither is the render clock, which is what keeps the whole choice off it.
// Above fullWidth the reference clause stops binding on its own: there the table
// states every figure and every countdown the rows contain, which no per-row
// layout of the same rows can beat at any width.
//
// The MESSAGE axis is priced HERE, at the render width, and it is the one axis
// that must be: a span message is width-bound in BOTH layouts — neither ever
// states more of one than the terminal holds — so demanding of the table what a
// wider reference showed would refuse it for a sentence no layout can fit. The
// table's message is never the shorter of the two at one width (spanIdentW), so
// this clause never moves the choice; it is the standing check that it never

// WHETHER A TABLE EXISTS IS ONE COMPARISON, `width >= minTableWidth(rows, opts)`,
// made before any layout: a closed-form floor that is a pure function of the rows
// and the surface. It reads no clock, so a countdown shortening between two
// frames ("2h 13m" → "9m" → "now") can never take the table away where no resize
// did; and it is monotone, so a terminal that grew never loses it.
//
// The width ladder, least informative rung first, re-measured after every
// single step so the table gives up only as much as the width demands:
//
//	(a) the HEADER TEXT, one abbreviation level at a time, all columns together
//	    and never past the level at which two labels would read alike
//	    (headerLadders)
//	(b) countdowns of UNCOUNTED columns, rightmost first
//	(c) countdowns of COUNTED non-binding columns, rightmost first
//	(d) the BINDING cell's countdown (held back to here on the surface whose own
//	    per-row layout holds it back: opts.policy.KeepBindingCountdown)
//	(e) the label cell, narrowing toward the bare ellipsis
//	(f) the countdown of an EXHAUSTED column, where that surface's per-row layout
//	    states one (opts.policy.PinExhausted)
//	(g) whole LABEL GROUPS, the group the FEWEST rows report going first — but
//	    never a PINNED one (pinTableColumns)
//	(h) a SPAN row's message, cut with the ellipsis marker, never past its floor
//	    (spanFloor)
//
// (a) sits above (e), and that much is FORCED: were a header worth more than the
// shared label, widening the terminal by one column would restore a header level
// before the label recovered, and every account's identity would SHRINK as the
// terminal grew. (a) sits above the countdowns because a name is not a
// measurement — the header names a column whose figures are on the screen either
// way, while a countdown is the only cell that says when a window frees up, and
// with real model names ("claude-opus-4-5-20251101") the header term is what
// makes a column dear at every ordinary width. (e) sits above (g) because a
// row's figures are what the row is for, and the slot number identifies it even
// with the label gone. (f) sits below (e) because an exhausted window's reset is
// the one countdown the per-row layout states unconditionally, so it is worth
// more than the shared email — and only on the surface that states it.
//
// Each rung is walked to EXHAUSTION before the next begins, which is what makes
// this order monotone as well as forced. (a) stops early only by FITTING, so a
// countdown is shed only at a width where the headers are already spelled at
// their coarsest: the surviving countdown set is then a function of the width
// and that one fixed level, never of a level that moves. Likewise the label
// narrows only once (a)–(d) are spent, so labelW = clamp(width − K, floor,
// labelWant) against a CONSTANT K, and a column drops only once the label is at
// its floor. Each quantity the reader sees is therefore monotone in the width on
// its own (I8).
//
// A SPAN row asks the same of (e), but only as far as its FLOOR: the label
// column is SHARED, and a message measured at its full width would buy itself
// room out of every other account's email — one long note (the 82-column
// re-login sentinel) erasing every healthy row's identity. So the quantity that
// drives (e) on a span row's behalf is spanFloorWidth, the row at the stub its
// message is guaranteed, never the message's own width; past that floor the
// message takes whatever ITS OWN label leaves over and (h) cuts it into that.
// Rungs (a)–(d), (f) and (g) touch WINDOW rows only, so they are walked only
// while the slot/label/column grid is what overflows (windowRowsWidth): no
// countdown a SPAN row does not carry, and no column it does not lay a figure
// into, can buy that row's message one column.
//
// A rung is exhausted before the next begins — a dropped column never buys the
// label its width back — so narrowing the terminal only ever takes detail away.
//
// now is the render clock in fractional Unix seconds; every countdown is
// derived from it live, never from a stored countdown string (09§12).
//
// It is a TEST SEAM and not a surface's entry point: a caller that renders on
// this alone renders a table its own per-row layout may beat. Both surfaces call

//     exhausted wherever it is rendered — and every other surface already says
//     it that way (accountCardText's bars, miniAccountText, tycswap list). A
//     counted figure in the plain foreground would read as unremarkable at the
//     very moment it matters most.
//   - BOLD, and bold alone, marks the row's BINDING window: the figure the
//     ranking orders by and the engine decides on. That is the cell's ROLE, not
//     its state, and the row needs both said at once. An uncounted window is
//     never the binding one, so bold stays where it is regardless.
//
// So a cell reads three ways, not two, and the third is the one the accounts
// monitor lives on. That surface enumerates its windows on the EMPTY model axis
// — every per-model window there is uncounted by construction — and a window at
// or over 100% is the single highest-value figure a row can carry: it says this
// account cannot serve that model at all, which is true on any axis and is
// exactly what miniAccountText has always said outright ("Fable (!)", in the
// critical color). An EXHAUSTED cell therefore carries its severity color
// whether or not it counts; only an uncounted window still short of its limit
// drives nothing and stays muted and dim. A stale measurement dims whichever
