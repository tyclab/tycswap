// sequence.go — the sequence.json model and its read/write discipline.
//
// Implements spec 01§2 (account metadata format) and 01§2.3 (_write_json). The
// top-level schema is a fixed four-key struct; each account RECORD is kept as a
// json.RawMessage so unknown keys and — critically — the absence of the
// optional alias/kind/disabled keys survive a read/mutate/rewrite byte-for-byte
// (spec 01§2.2 additivity rule, risk 3). Writes go through a Python-parity
// json.dumps(indent=2) rendering (two-space indent, no trailing newline, no
// HTML escaping) with a re-parse validation guard that maps to ConfigError
// "Generated invalid JSON".
//
// Two reads, one file: ReadSequence keeps Python's contract (absent and
// unreadable alike are None) for the many callers that only display or inspect;
// SequenceForUpdate keeps them apart for the callers that are about to write,
// because an empty roster is the truth for one and destroys the user's data for
// the other. Every operation that can end in a write begins with exactly one
// classified read (SequenceForUpdate / MigratedSequenceForUpdate) and threads
// that roster through its own writes: a re-fetch mid-operation can only
// introduce disagreement with the roster its decisions were made against.
