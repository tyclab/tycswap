// remove.go — RemoveAccount: permanently remove a managed slot.
//
// Implements spec 01§10.2 (remove_account): the identifier gate (digit / alias /
// format-valid email, with interactive disambiguation of a multi-match email),
// the live-session refusal before the prompt, the active-slot warning, the
// confirmation, and the delete + sequence prune + mapping prune.
//
// The confirmation is a human pause, so it runs before the store lock; the
// delete and the roster commit run inside it, against a roster read there, and
// the slot is RE-RESOLVED under the lock before anything is deleted — a
// concurrent move or swap can renumber a slot, and a concurrent remove can
// retire it entirely, so the identity the user confirmed has to still be the one
// standing in that slot.

	//     slot's backup config until the lazy backfill lifts them into the
	//     records, and the disambiguation list below renders its tags from these
	//     records. Un-backfilled, every same-email candidate prints [personal] —
	//     on the one screen whose whole purpose is telling them apart, immediately
